            <h3>Reviews</h3>
            <p>Reviews, interviews and menu tastings will help you find the right catering choice for your big day. Start by screening possible wedding caterers based on past reviews. If a caterer you are interested in has a review that concerns you, ask them about it; how they respond will be important to know if you would need them for your wedding.</p>

                <h4> Cost of hiring</h4>
                <p>Catering prices depend mainly on how fancy you want the food and service to be and how many guests you’ll have. When you’re first looking to hire a caterer for your event, consider how many guests you’ll have and your total food and drink budget. The national average for event catering is $340, but catering prices can range into the thousands depending on your menu, guest count, and service.</p>

                        <div class="col-md-3">Ugali
                            <p style="background-color: slategrey">The undeniable most common Kenyan food staple is ugali – usually made from cornmeal that is added to boiling water and heated until it turns into a dense block of cornmeal paste. Ugali has the consistency of a grainy dough and the heaviness of a brick.

                                    For many Kenyans, ugali along with a small amount of cooked vegetables or saucy stew is a normal meal.</p>

                        <div class="col-md-3">Irio
                            <p style="background-color: teal">Irio is one of the most famous dishes in Kenya, a food that originated as a Kikuyu staple and spread throughout the country.

                                    Green peas and potatoes are boiled and then mashed up before whole kernels of maize (corn) are added to give the mash some extra starch and texture. This hearty and heavy Kenyan food is famous to eat with roasted nyama choma meat (nyama na irio) or just some Kenyan style stew.</p>

                        <div class="col-md-3">Nyama choma
                            <p style="background-color: brown">Any Kenyan food list is not complete without a mention of nyama choma, also known as roasted meat. Goat and beef are the 2 most common forms of nyama choma, but chicken (kuku choma) and fish (samaki choma) are also valid choices.

                                    Fat and the grizzle from the meat is the choice part of the animal, and is often consumed with a quick dip into a pile of salt for extra flavoring! It’s also possible at many places to get the “fry,” – the fried meat variation.</p>

                        <div class="col-md-3"><b>Matoke</b>
                            <img src="11.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" style="width:500px;height:600px;">

                            <p style="background-color:slateblue">Matoke is originally a dish from Uganda, though it is widely available and popular in Kenya as well.

                                    Plantain bananas are cooked up in a pot with some oil, tomatoes, onions, garlic, chilies, meat (optional), and lemon juice. The bananas are cooked until they become soft and begin to form a thick sauce with the other ingredients.
                                    
                                    The result is a delicious dish that is reminiscent of boiled potatoes in sauce and excellent to eat with rice, ugali, or a chapati.</p>
